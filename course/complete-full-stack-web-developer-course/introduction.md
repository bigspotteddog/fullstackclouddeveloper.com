##### My Online Marketplace, June 2023 - Present
Design and develop an online marketplace for customer order processing and merchant product maintenance leveraging HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Java, SpringBoot, PostgreSQL, with automated build, test, and deployment using Terraform and Jenkins deployed to AWS. Leverage Jira, Confluence, and GitHub pull requests to collaborate with team members and product owners to determine requirements, do work breakdown, acceptance criteria, and estimation (using t-shirt sizes) to create Jira tickets for the team backlog, using a SCRUM methodology with 2-week sprints.

* **Front End Development**

  Develop website pages per UX design for an online marketplace including customer product browse and search, product view, shopping cart, payment, shipment, order tracking, and merchant product and order management pages, leveraging HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and Bootstrap. Used Fetch API to maintain product and order information via REST API that interfaces to customer and merchant APIs. Behavioral driven development (BDD) used to create front end unit tests using Jasmine.

  Develop RESTful web APIs to manage customer orders and maintain merchant products for an online marketplace, leveraging Java and SpringBoot, connected to a PostgreSQL database using JPA to implement data access objects in using JDBC and SQL to create, read, update, and delete database records. Use Liquibase for database schema maintenance. Test-driven development (TDD) used to create backend unit tests using JUnit and Mockito. Payment processing using Stripe.

* **DevOps**

  Automate build, test and deploy an online markeplace to AWS utilizing Jenkins for CI/CD and terraform for Infrastructure as Code deployment. The front end for customer and merchant assets are deloyed to S3 buckets serving as websites fronted by a CloudFront CDN using TLS v1.3 certificates accessing customer and merchant docker services deployed to Fargate using custom domains routed through Route 53.
