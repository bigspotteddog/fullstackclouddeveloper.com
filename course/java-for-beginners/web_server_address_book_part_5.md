## Full Stack Address Book - Part 5

In part 5 of this exercise, we will add a link to the address in the table and use JavaScript to populate the form for editing. Then, we will change the UrlFetch method to POST or PUT depending on a new record or an edited record. Finally, we will send the record to the server. In the next part, we will update the record on the server.
