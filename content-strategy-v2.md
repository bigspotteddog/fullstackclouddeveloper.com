# Content Strategy V2: Small Business Technical Partner

**Goal:** Position Joseph as the one-stop technical partner for small businesses.
**Core Message:** "I build the tech your business needs today, and the systems you'll need tomorrow."
**Audience:** Small business owners who need a website now but want a partner who can handle complexity later.

## Structure Updates

1.  **Hero Section**
    *   Headline: **Technical Solutions for Growing Businesses.**
    *   Subheadline: From professional websites to custom business software. I build exactly what you need—whether you're just starting out or ready to scale.

2.  **Services (Reframed)**
    *   **Professional Websites:** High-quality, mobile-friendly websites that establish credibility and drive customers.
    *   **Custom Business Tools:** Booking systems, client portals, inventory management—software tailored to *your* workflow.
    *   **Technical Growth Partner:** You don't need a full-time IT department. You need a partner who can solve technical problems as they arise.
    *   **Scalable Solutions:** "I can build almost anything." As you grow, I build the complex systems that handle your success.

3.  **Why Me?**
    *   **One-Stop Shop:** No need to hire separate web designers, developers, and consultants.
    *   **Future-Proof:** I build with professional standards so you don't have to rebuild later.
    *   **Experience:** 20+ years means I've seen it all and can solve it quickly.

4.  **Case Studies (Simplified)**
    *   Focus on the *outcome* (market growth, user engagement) rather than just the tech stack.
